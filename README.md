Introduction

A tutorial to teach Python through a series of exercises based around die rolls.

Background
-
Years ago I was inspired by the [Dice-O-Matic](http://gamesbyemail.com/news/diceomatic). It is a machine capable of rolling millions of dice for games requiring standard, six-sided dice. But what about games that require other dice?  It got me thinking about writing an algorithm that could convert multiple six-sided die rolls into N-sided die rolls. Or even M-sided die rolls into N-sided die rolls.
